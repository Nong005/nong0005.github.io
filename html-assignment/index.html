        <p>During my formative years, I developed a passion for <em>drawing and painting.</em> At 13<sup>th</sup>, I earn recognition at both <em>State and National levels,</em> including <strong>Lions Peace Poster Contest </strong> organised by Lions Club of International. Hailing from Manipur, India, I aspire to merge my artistic talents with modern technology, now pursuing <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> at <strong>Algonquin College, Canada.</strong> The courses here are truly inspiring, making me optimistic about realizing my dreams. </p>
<p>Beyond my artistic pursuits, I am an avid explorer of cultures and cuisines. <em>Traveling has opened my eyes to diverse traditions and flavours, enriching my understanding of the world.</em> Whether savoring traditional <em>Emrati Cusine</em> in the bustling markets of <strong>Dubai</strong> or admiring the breathtaking beauty of <strong>Niagara Falls</strong>, each experience fuels my curosity and appreciation for life's wonders.</p>
